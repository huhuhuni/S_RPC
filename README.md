# S_RPC

S_RPC is a simple RPC framework designed to provide the ability to call methods remotely.

## S_RPC-0.2

S_RPC-0.1 is developed using the Java language, highly coupled with the Java language, and the communication mode of Socket is based on BIO implementation,It uses Java's native serialization mechanism,It uses Java's object proxy technology.

### TODO list

- [x] The remote object's method invoke
- [x] Object serialization transfer
- [x] The socket transmission
- [x] object proxy
- [ ] NIO
- [ ] Asynchronous transmission
- [ ] Efficient serialization
